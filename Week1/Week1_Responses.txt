Cutting Points for Testing - 
	To test my program, I am planning to test the "Physics Engine" task and "LED Output Task". For both tasks, I will test to see if 
the inputs produce the desired task outputs. I will create unit tests for this in the near future.


Schedule -

Task diagram - 2 hours
Gather Relevant Physics Equations- 1 hour
Learn how to further display geometry and physics on LCD screen - 3 hours
Implement Slider Shield Task - 2 hours
Test Shield Task Produces Desired Output - 1 hour
Implement Slider Physics Task - 2 hours
Test Physics Task Produces Desired Output - 1 hour
Implement Physics Engine - 4 hours
Test Physics Task Produces Desired Output - 2 hours
Implement LED Output Task - 1 hour
Test LED Task Produces Desired Output - 2 hours
Implement LCD Task, create geometry - 4 hours
Create Unit Tests for project - 4 hours
Run unit tests on project - 4 hours

Estimate Total Time: 31 hours
