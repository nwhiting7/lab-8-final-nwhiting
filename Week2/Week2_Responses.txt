Week #2 -

-------------------------------------------------------------------Statement of where project stands:
	This week, I completed the platform task and part of the slider shield/nuke task. I began to further explore the physics equations that control the slider and functions that draw geometry on the LCD screen. I also implemented a function to draw the canyon width according to the user-specified width and of began to develop the physics engine and slider task to handle the slider implementation of the game.
	For this upcoming week, I am planning to finish the slider shield/nuke task and additional slider physics task functionality to begin the planned unit tests for the slider shiled/nuke task and slider physics task.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------Summary effort and estimate numbers:
I completed around 20% of the project timeline so far in about 10 hours. This required about 1.25x more time than initially expected. I have added time for additional unit tests as I want to incrementally test my project and want to create the slider task first before moving on. I have added an additional 4 hours for unit tests for final, completed project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------Test Plan and Results
	To test my program, I am planning to test the "Physics Engine" task, "slider shield/nuke" task, and "platform" task. The reason for this is that I want to make sure that the foundation of the game is reliable before creating any additional functionality.
	
	All unit tests are in status: Not Run
	Unit Test 1 - Slider shield and nuke indicators are registered.
	Unit Test 2 - Nuke ability can only be used three times
	Unit Test 3 - Shield ability stays active for specified amount of time, even if button is held. Shield ability should rearm after specified amount of time.
	Unit Test 4 - Slider Shield/Nuke task correctly set flags.
	Unit Test 5 - Canyon data structure is correctly initializaed with user-specified parameters.
	Unit Test 6 - Platform data structure is correctly initialized with user-specified parameters.
	Unit Test 7 - When bounce from walls is enabled, velocity of platform is changed to same velocity, but opposite direction.
	Unit Test 8 - When bounce from walls limited is enabled, signal to destroy platform when platform speed is too high is indicated.
	Unit Test 9 - Slider physics equations produce correct outcomes and correspond to user-specified values.
	Unit Test 10 - Slider shield collision with Holtzman masses correctly increments kinetic energy by user-specified value.
