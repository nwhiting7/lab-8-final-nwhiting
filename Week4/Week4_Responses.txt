Week #3 -

-------------------------------------------------------------------Statement of where project stands:
	This week, I worked on the physics implementation for the Holtzman mass. I clarified the physics equations with the professor and know exactly how to implement the physics. As I was working on the physics and had the professor review my project, I realized that I implemented the canyon and slider distance functionality wrong. As a result, I need to correct the canyon distance and platform distance functionality and update the slider physics to create the desired functionality. In addition, I created 10 functional tests to check along the development process of this project. Once I update the canyon and slider length functionality, I should be finishing up the holtzman mass physics and hopfully almost finished with the project.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------Summary effort and estimate numbers:
I completed around 44% of the project timeline so far in about 16.5 hours. This required about 1.25x more time than initially expected. I have added time for additional unit tests as I may need to add more 
tests based on necesary unforseen issues that I may encounter due to not having some of the functions completed. I have added an additional 4 hours for unit tests for final, completed project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------Funtional Tests
Test #1:
Ensure that when the game starts, the LCD screen has a canyon wall of the left and right of the screen, A platform at the bottom of the screen, three dots at the bottom middle of the screen to represent the amount of laser defense uses left, and a Holtzman mass is falling at a reasonable speed.

Test #2:
Press left half of the capsense sensor. Ensure platfrom moves left at reasonable speed to counterract holtzman masses.
Press righ half of the capsense sensor. Ensure platform moves to the right at reasonable speed to counterract holtzman masses.

Test #3: 
Press left half of capsense sensor to generate a small amount of force. Perform this when near the left canyon wall and ensure the slider bounces after colliding with the cayon wall. 
Press right half of capsense sensor to generate a small amount of force. Perform this when near the right canyon wall and ensure the slider bounces after colliding with the cayon wall. 

Test #4: 
Center the slider in th middle of the screen. Press the left half of the capsense slier to generate a significant speed. Ram the slider into the left canyon wall. Ensure the slider is destroyed and there is a message stating "Game Over, Slider was Destroyed!".
Center the slider in th middle of the screen. Press the right half of the capsense slier to generate a significant speed. Ram the slider into the right canyon wall. Ensure the slider is destroyed and there is a message stating "Game Over, Slider was Destroyed!".
