----------------------------------------------------------------------Funtional Tests-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Test #1:
Ensure that when the game starts there is a platform at the bottom of the screen, number of lasers displayed at top left of screen, number of masses left at
the top left of the screen and a Holtzman mass is falling between the left and right sides of the screen.

Test #2(Bounce Disabled):
Press and hold leftmost slider sensor. Ensure platfrom moves left at max_force and LED1 is lit. Leftmost side of Platform should collide with the wall and not move off screen.
Press rightmost side of slider sensor. Ensure platfrom moves right at max_force and LED1 is lit. Rightmost side of Platform should collide with the wall and not move off screen.
Press middle-left slider sensor. Ensure pltform is traveling to the left at half of max force and LED1 is flashing with duty cycle of 50% and frequency of 1 Hz.
Press middle-right slider sensor. Ensure pltform is traveling to the right at half of max force and LED1 is flashing with duty cycle of 50% and frequency of 1 Hz.

Test #3(Bounce Enabled): 
Center platform. Press and hold leftmost slider sensor. Ensure platfrom moves left at max_force and LED1 is lit. Leftmost side of Platform should collide with the wall and bgin moving at the same speed in the opposite direction.
Press rightmost side of slider sensor. Ensure platfrom moves right at max_force and LED1 is lit. Rightmost side of Platform should collide with the wall and move in the opposite direction at the same speed.
Press middle-left slider sensor. Ensure pltform is traveling to the left at half of max force and LED1 is flashing with duty cycle of 50% and frequency of 1 Hz.
Press middle-right slider sensor. Ensure pltform is traveling to the right at half of max force and LED1 is flashing with duty cycle of 50% and frequency of 1 Hz.

Test #4(Bounce Limit):
Center slider. With bounce limit enabled, increase slider speed until greater than bounce limit and collide platform with wall. Screen should display "game over, platform destroyed".

Test #5:
Center the slider in the middle of the screen, press BTN1, ensure that there is an outline displyed around the slider after the arm delay time, representing the shield. The shield should last for time specified in struct.
Press BTN1 to reactivate shield, press BTN1 while shield is active, shield should still only last specified amount of time.
Press BTN1 immediately after shield deactivates, shield should not activate as it is recharging.

Test #6:
Center the slider under the falling Holtzman mass, ensure that when the holtman mass collides with the sider, the Holtman mass bounces with less kinetic energy (height) than before.

Test #7:
Position slider underneath falling Holtzman mass, activate shield while the Holtzman mass bounces off the platform. Ensure that the mass bounces off the platform with more energy than what the Holtzman mass was falling with.

Test #8: Let mass fall through bottom of the screen. Message displaying "Game Over" should be displayed. LED0 should be flashing with duty cycle of 50% and a frequency of 1 hertz.

Test #9: Increase Kinetic energy of mass until it bounces above the top of the screen. Number of Holtzman masses should decrease at the top left corner. When 
number of masses drops to zero, screen should display, "You Win!".

Test #10: Press BTN0 when mass is falling. Holtzman mass should be reset and number of lasers and number of masses should be decreased by one.

Test #11: When Lasers left is zero and BTN0 is pressed, laser functionality should not work and number of lasers should still be zero.

Test #12:
When slider is directly underneath falling mass, LED0 should be lit. As platform gets farther away from mass, LED1 should begin to have a lower duty cycle with a frequency if 1 hz.
