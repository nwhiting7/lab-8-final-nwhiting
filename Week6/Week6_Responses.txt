Week #6 -

-------------------------------------------------------------------Statement of where project stands:
	For the final week, I cleaned up my code and added LED functionality as well as the laser auto control functionality. In addition, I revised my unit tests, functional tests, and cleaned up my project code in preparation for our demo. While it seems the LED functionality works, I am not convined the functionality of LED0 works to give feedback about the position of the platform in relation to the Holtzman mass. I may lose a few points if this functionality does not work during the demo.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------Summary effort and estimate numbers:
I completed around 95% of the project timeline so far in about 36 hours. This required about 1.6x more time than initially expected. As my project stands, it functions correctly from a gameplay standpoint with the default parameters provided from week 5. I am concerned that I may have bugs that will come to light during demo, but the project functions correctly with the struct provided from week 5.
